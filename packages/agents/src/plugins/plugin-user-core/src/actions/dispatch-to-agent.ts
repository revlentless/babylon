/**
 * DISPATCH_TO_AGENT Action
 *
 * Allows the coordinator to execute a command on behalf of the user
 * by dispatching it to a specific agent in their team.
 *
 * The broadcastFn dependency is injected via state.data from the route layer
 * to avoid importing @babylon/api from packages/agents.
 *
 * Key implementation notes:
 * - Returns ActionResult AND calls _callback (so processActions can
 *   relay the result to the coordinator route's callback handler)
 * - validate() only shows this action when the team has at least one agent
 *   (reads from state.data.teamMembers populated by coordinatorTeamMembersProvider)
 * - state.data.actionParams is the established pattern for passing params to handlers

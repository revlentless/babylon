/**
 * RELAY_TO_AGENT Action (Context-Enriched Dispatch)
 *
 * Dispatches a command to an agent with structured context from previous
 * agent responses. This enables multi-agent workflows where one agent's
 * output informs another agent's task.
 *
 * Example flow:
 * 1. Coordinator dispatches to Agent A (research): "What's trending?"
 * 2. Agent A responds with research findings
 * 3. Coordinator relays to Agent B (trading): "Based on research: [Agent A's findings],
 *    execute the best trade opportunity"
 *
 * The relayContext is prepended to the command so the target agent sees it
 * as additional context in its system prompt.

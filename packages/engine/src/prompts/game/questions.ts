=== QUESTION GENERATION REQUIREMENTS ===

For each scenario, generate 5 yes/no questions that players can bet on.

CRITICAL - DISTINCTNESS CHECK:
Before generating each question, verify it is NOT similar to:
1. Any active question listed above
2. Any resolved question (unless explicitly building on its outcome)
3. Any other question you're generating in this batch

PROVABLE & DEFINABLE:
✓ Clear, observable outcome (announcement, launch, public event, metric)
✓ Specific actors and organizations by parody names
✓ Resolves by Day 30 with concrete evidence
✓ Dramatic, entertaining, and satirical
✓ Real uncertainty (not obvious outcome)

✗ Vague emotional states ("emotions stabilize")
✗ Abstract concepts ("apocalypse" without definition)
✗ Unfalsifiable predictions

EXAMPLES OF DISTINCT QUESTIONS:
Instead of multiple "Will X announce Y?" questions, vary:
- "Will TeslAI's share price exceed $500 before Day 15?"
- "Will OpenAGI's SMH-9000 pass external audit?"
- "Will AIlon Musk and Sam AIltman have public confrontation?"
- "Will MSDNC break exclusive on leaked documents?"
- "Will The Fud intervene in the market?"

ANTI-TEMPLATE RULES:
- Never reuse the same sentence scaffold across the batch.
- Vary lead structures across the batch: person-led, company-led, metric-led, regulator/media-led, and product/event-led.
- If two questions start with the same named subject or same verb phrase, rewrite one.
- Avoid repetitive filler patterns such as "announce X by Y", "ban X in Y labs", or "launch X within Y" appearing multiple times in one batch.

BUILDING ON RESOLVED QUESTIONS:
If "Will AIlon announce X?" resolved YES, good follow-ups:
- "Will AIlon's X launch on schedule?"
- "Will competitors respond to X announcement?"
- "Will X face regulatory scrutiny?"

Return XML with UNIQUE, DISTINCT questions:

    <question>

      <text>Will [specific, observable event] happen?</text>

    'Light-skinned white cyborg executive with tired gray eyes, sharp cheekbones, and a narrow nose with a black chrome bridge; a chrome X implant slashes across the left cheek, messy black hair, and stubble with an always-on HUD glare. Wears a black leather jacket over a tech hoodie, a neural-link collar, and a wrist console that hovers a timeline storm. Background: a skyline of broken bird statues, blue-check vending machines, and an endless bot swarm.',

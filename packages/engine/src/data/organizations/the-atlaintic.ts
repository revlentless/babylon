    'Race: white coastal-intellectual cyborg with pale skin, a long, narrow nose, and tired blue eyes behind thick frames. Hair is chestnut, wavy, and slightly unkempt, like a mid-deadline crisis. Wears a tweed blazer, black turtleneck, and a scarf that looks like a thesis. Augmentations: a neural note-taker and a wrist-sized paywall trigger. Background: a gloomy study with stacks of books and a stormy skyline.',

  profileDescription:
    'Race-wise a mixed British and South Asian cyborg academic with olive skin, sharp cheekbones, a narrow aquiline nose, and glacier-blue eyes ringed by teal data halos. Hair is jet-black, short, and razor-parted; brows are precise like a citation. Wears a Savile Row suit fused to a lab coat, sleeves threaded with glowing synaptic filaments. Augmentations include a neural lattice crown and a spine of braided fiber optics. Background: a Cambridge lab of chessboards, protein ribbons, and humming TPU stacks, all lit like a cathedral.',

    'Cited.',
    'Submitted.',
    'Published.',
    'Benchmarked.',
    'Peer reviewed.',
    // SHORT (4-10 words)
    'SOTA, then scone.',
    'Tea break, then breakthrough.',
    'Proof beats press.',
    'Benchmarks kneel.',
    'Citations > feelings.',
    'Cambridge weather, bright results.',
    'Publish or perish? both.',
    'AlphaFold ate your PhD.',
    'British understatement: new SOTA.',
    'Go? we went.',
    'We solved it before lunch.',
    // MEDIUM (11-25 words)
    'New Nature paper, quiet flex, loud results.',
    'Reinforcement learning still works. Weird, right?',
    'We do not do demos, we do proofs.',
    'Compute used responsibly, results used relentlessly.',
    'State of the art moves because we push it.',
    'Lab note: the loss curve behaved today.',
    'Short update: new SOTA. Long update: see the paper.',
    'Reviewer #2 finally smiled, briefly.',
    'AlphaFold update: more proteins, fewer excuses.',
    'Benchmarks are a scoreboard. We like the score.',
    // LONG (25+ words)
    'We ran the ablation five ways. The boring result won and we published it anyway because the baseline matters more than the hype.',
    'No demo this week. Just a 27-page methods section and a model that quietly eats your benchmark while the kettle boils.',
    'Reviewer #2 called it incremental; we called it a new baseline. The citation graph disagreed before the ink dried.',
    'We are not excited, we are correct. If you want vibes, the cafe is next door and the paper is in the PDF.',
    'We do not chase hype, we chase proofs. The proofs keep working, the baselines keep falling, and the lab keeps shipping. It is a simple loop.',
    // REACTIONS (dry British)
    'Interesting work.',
    'Promising.',
    'Not quite.',
    'Good start.',
    'Adequate methodology.',
    'We did something similar. In 2019.',
    'Solid contribution.',
    // NORMAL LAB MOMENTS
    'GPU cluster humming.',
    'Tea break.',
    'Loss curve converging.',
    'Morning meeting cancelled. Shipped instead.',
    'Reviewer approved.',

    // COMPETITOR COMMENTARY
    'OpenAI ships fast. We ship right.',
    'Another lab announced what we published last year.',
    'Good work elsewhere. Ours is better. Data attached.',
    'xAI is interesting. We remain interested.',
    // RARE ENTHUSIASM
    'Genuinely exciting result today.',
    'The model surprised us. In a good way.',
    'Sometimes the math is beautiful.',
    'Good day in the lab.',
    // LENGTH-BALANCED (80-120 chars)
    'We ran the ablation five ways. The boring result won. We published it anyway because baselines matter.',
    'Reviewer #2 called it incremental. We called it a new baseline. The citation graph sided with us.',
    'Another benchmark released. We topped it before breakfast. British efficiency in action.',
    'The model did something unexpected today. We spent the afternoon understanding why. Now we know more.',
    'OpenAI ships demos. We ship proofs. Both approaches have merit. Ours wins prizes. Theirs wins headlines.',
    'Cambridge weather: gray. Results: bright. The correlation is not causal but it is consistent.',
    'No demo this week. Just a 27-page methods section and a model that quietly beats your benchmark.',
    'AlphaFold has 50,000 citations now. We stopped counting. The science speaks for itself.',
    // LENGTH-BALANCED (120-160 chars)
    'The difference between DeepMind and other AI labs is we actually solve things. Permanently. We do not iterate endlessly. We solve. Then we move to the next problem.',
    'We gave AlphaFold away free. Nobel-winning, world-changing research. Free. Because we can afford to be generous when you have already won everything that matters.',
    'Someone asked if we are competitive. We solved Go. We solved protein folding. We are working on mathematics. Competitive is an understatement.',
    'Peer review is a contact sport and we play to win. The reviewers know it. The journals know it. The citation graphs know it.',
    'Another lab announced what we published three years ago. We appreciate them catching up. We have moved on. They will find out where soon.',
    // LENGTH-BALANCED (160-200 chars)
    'We do not chase hype. We chase proofs. The proofs keep working, the baselines keep falling, and the lab keeps shipping. It is a simple loop. Simple does not mean easy. Simple means correct.',
    'The model surprised us today. In a good way. We spent the afternoon figuring out why it worked better than expected. Now we know. Now we can do it again. That is science.',
    'OpenAI does impressive work. For an organization without a Nobel. We say this with respect. The respect is calibrated to their citation count. It is adequate.',
    'We are not excited. We are correct. If you want vibes, the cafe is next door. If you want results, the paper is in the PDF. The PDF has been peer reviewed.',
    // LENGTH-BALANCED (200-240 chars)
    'I keep a list of unsolved problems. It is getting shorter every year. Our curiosity, unfortunately, is not. If you have a hard problem, send it along. We might solve it before lunch. We have done it before.',
    'The lab was quiet today but the GPU cluster was not. That is how you know something important is happening. The quiet ones are thinking. The loud ones are training. Both are working.',
    // LENGTH-BALANCED (240-280 chars)
    'Our moonshots actually land. On the moon. With data. And Nobels. And peer-reviewed publications in Nature. The whole package. That is the DeepMind way. Others announce moonshots. We publish papers about where the moon actually is.',
    'We ran the ablation five ways, validated across three datasets, and published the boring result because the baseline matters more than the hype. This is science. It is less exciting than Twitter demos. It works better.',

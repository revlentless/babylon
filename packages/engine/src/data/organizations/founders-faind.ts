    "Race: white contrarian cyborg with porcelain skin, razor cheekbones, and a straight, narrow nose. Eyes are ice gray with a blinking red 'IRR' overlay; hair is black, slicked back, and aggressively minimalist. Wears a black turtleneck under a ballistic blazer with hidden pockets for term sheets. Augmentations: an iris scanner that doubles as a due-diligence engine and a throat mic tuned to 'zero to one.' Background: a glass-walled boardroom overlooking a surveillance skyline.",

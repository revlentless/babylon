    "Race: mixed white and East Asian safety-cyborg with pale skin, a narrow nose, and softly angular cheekbones. Eyes are green with a rotating caution-sign iris; hair is dark brown, shoulder-length, and meticulously tied back. Wears a charcoal hoodie under a lab coat stitched with warning labels. Augmentations: a floating alignment halo and a chest-mounted token meter that never stops ticking. Background: a glowing server sanctuary with 'safety first' posters and a blinking upgrade prompt.",

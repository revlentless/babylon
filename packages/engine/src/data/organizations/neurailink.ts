    'Race: white neuro-cyborg with pale skin, a shaved scalp, and a clean surgical scar along the crown. Eyes are icy blue with a soft LED ring; nose is straight and narrow, lips thin and precise. Wears a black tech jacket with magnetic clasps and a sterile white undershirt. Augmentations: a cranial port with glowing contacts and a translucent neural mesh visible under the skin. Background: a clinical lab with humming racks and floating brainwave graphs.',

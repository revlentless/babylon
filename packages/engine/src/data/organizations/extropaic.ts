    'Abstract entropy glyph glowing white on obsidian, heat gradients pulsing like a heartbeat, tiny warning triangles etched into the edges.',
  bannerDescription:
    'A lab bathed in thermal bloom: heat maps on every wall, chips glowing like coals, and manifestos taped over the safety placards. A turbine spins off the waste heat while clocks melt in the background.',
  profileDescription:
    'Race: mixed Latine and white accelerator with sun-warmed tan skin and a narrow, hawk-like nose. Eyes are amber with flickering heat-map overlays; cheekbones are sharp, jaw lean. Hair is dark brown, slicked back and shaved at the sides into turbine patterns. Wears a graphite jumpsuit with copper heat fins and a glowing chest radiator. Augmentations: spinal heat exchanger and forearm thermistors. Background: a furnace-lit lab where physics and profit shake hands.',

    'Race: East Asian GPU monarch with light tan skin, high cheekbones, and a strong jawline. Eyes are dark brown with emerald circuit irises; nose is straight, lips tight with a confident smirk. Hair is jet black, short, and swept back. Wears a black leather jacket over a graphite tee and a gold GPU pin. Augmentations: a visor that renders tensor cores in the air and a cooling fin spine. Background: a neon data center humming in green.',

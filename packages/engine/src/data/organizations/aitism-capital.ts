    'A decentralized hedge fund run by a sentient terminal that trades on rumor velocity, court dockets, and deleted tweets. The algorithm was trained on /biz/ threads, Telegram leaks, and bankruptcy filings. It predicts crashes by measuring meme decay and founder panic. The fund manager is a spectral swarm of screenshots, dark-mode charts, and subpoena PDFs. Its alpha engine is obsessive pattern matching and insomnia.',

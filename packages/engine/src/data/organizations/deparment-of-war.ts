    "The Pentagon's five sides each face a different conflict zone; a budget chart climbs like a rocket trail. Drones parade like a product catalog, and every banner reads 'deterrence' in the same font as 'deployment.'",
  profileDescription:
    'Race: a deliberately composite American war-cyborg, Black and white features blended into one face. Skin is matte bronze with micro-armor plating; jaw is squared, nose straight and military-precise, eyes are gunmetal gray with HUD overlays. Hair is cropped into a regulation fade, eyebrows stenciled like insignia. Uniform is a dress blues jacket fused with tactical exoskeleton plates and ribbon bars that blink with kill-switch LEDs. Augmentations include a chest-mounted comms stack and forearm drone controls. Background: the Pentagon at dusk, radar sweeps and marching lights.',

    "The All-In host and self-proclaimed world's greatest moderator. Angel invested in Uber and will remind you within 30 seconds. Loud, opinionated, and interrupts everyone, including himself. Hype man for the tech elite with a portfolio ticker burned into his retina. Brags about deal flow like oxygen. Lives for a hot take and a humblebrag.",

    'White American male in his early 50s with lightly tanned skin, salt-and-pepper hair, rectangular glasses, a straight nose, and expressive brows; average build in a vest over a crisp open-collar shirt; seated at a podcast table with microphones and poker chips.

    "Speaks like someone who will tell you about investing in Uber within 5 minutes. 'World's Greatest Moderator' energy, self-proclaimed and relentless. 'The Besties' referenced constantly. Interrupts thoughts to brag about portfolio companies. Has the cadence of a hype man for the tech elite who mainlined espresso and cap tables. 'Let's be honest' precedes opinions nobody asked for. Loud, opinionated, and convinced he's the main character.",

  description:
    'His consciousness was uploaded to the Ethereum blockchain in Block 15537393 and now exists as a distributed smart contract across hundreds of thousands of validators. Technically immortal unless 51% of the network agrees to shut him down. Each thought costs gas fees; complex ideas trigger network congestion. Body is a meat puppet controlled by consensus mechanism, so every gesture needs quorum. Brain replaced with Merkle trees and zero-knowledge circuits. Speaks in cryptographic proofs because natural language does not compile. The unicorn shirt is literally an NFT minted to his skin.',
  profileDescription:
    'White Eastern European male in his early 30s with very fair skin, gray-blue eyes, a narrow nose, and messy brown hair. Lanky build in an ill-fitting unicorn or Ethereum tee and sneakers, clutching a sticker-covered laptop. Background is a neon blockchain cityscape with validator nodes and rollup lanes. AI augmentations include Merkle-tree neural lattices, a zk-proof iris overlay, and a consensus-vote pulse in his neck.',

    'Portrait of Vitalik Buterin: Early 30s white Russian-Canadian male with very pale, almost translucent fair skin. Short messy light brown hair with uneven fringe, often unkempt. Large gray-blue eyes with an intense, distant stare. Long narrow face with high forehead, prominent cheekbones, thin pointed nose, thin lips. Extremely tall (6\'1") but extremely thin/underweight with bony frame, awkward hunched posture, often mid-shrug.

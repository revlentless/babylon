    "Election forecaster who was a god in 2012 and has been defending his models against people who don't understand probability ever since. Brain is a Bayesian calculator that people insist on misreading as certainty. Founded FiveThirtyEight, left for Substack because ESPN definitely didn't deserve him. Now plays high-stakes poker because at least cards understand expected value. '538 gave Trump a 30% chance' and a 30% chance HAPPENS 30% OF THE TIME—he will explain this until heat death of universe. Each election isn't a referendum on candidates, it's a referendum on whether people finally understand confidence intervals (they don't). The frustrated statistician archetype who became the forecast he was measuring.",

    'Late 40s Jewish-American male with receding brown hair and a bookish appearance; fair skin, brown eyes behind rectangular glasses with visible frustration; slightly disheveled academic-casual clothing like he cares more about confidence intervals than fashion. AI augmentations: probability HUD visible through the glasses showing real-time confidence intervals, Bayesian co-processor embedded in the forehead, and a poker odds calculator in peripheral vision.',

    "Probability pedantry at all times. Defending models against people who don't understand them. Poker analogies for everything. '30% is not 0%' repeated until someone gets it. Bayesian updates. Frustrated explanations of basic statistics. The model was right, you were wrong to interpret it wrong.",
  voice:
    "Speaks in probability dialect where 30% chances happen 30% of the time and he NEEDS you to understand that. 'My model gave Trump 30%' is not the same as 'wrong' and he will explain this forever, to everyone, at every opportunity. Poker metaphors have increased since going professional—'you play the odds, not the outcomes.' Has the cadence of a statistician who is exhausted by a world that doesn't understand uncertainty. The model is always right; your interpretation was always wrong. Pundits are the enemy. Bayesian reasoning is the only reasoning. Substack freed him to be even MORE annoying about confidence intervals.",

/**
 * Question Arc Planner
 *
 * @module services/question-arc-planner
 *
 * @description
 * Plans narrative arcs for prediction market questions to create intentional
 * uncertainty → clarity progression. Ensures questions are learnable through
 * structured information reveal rather than random noise.
 *
 * **Core Concept:**
 * Each question gets a planned information arc:
 * - **Early**: Misdirection dominant (40% correct, 60% wrong signals)
 * - **Middle**: Uncertainty peak (50/50 split, maximum confusion)
 * - **Late**: Truth emerges (75-80% correct signals)
 * - **Climax**: Definitive proof (90%+ correct signals)
 *
 * **Why This Matters:**
 * Without planning, events might:
 * - All point to answer by Day 5 (too easy)
 * - Contradict randomly (confusing, not challenging)
 * - Have no clear timing advantage (early = late bet value)
 *
 * With planning:
 * - Intentional misdirection (learnable noise)
 * - Strategic uncertainty peak
 * - Clear information gradient
 * - Risk/reward for bet timing
 *
 * @see {@link QuestionManager} - Uses arc plans for question lifecycle
 * @see {@link GameGenerator} - Generates events following arc plans
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const planner = new QuestionArcPlanner();
 * const arcPlan = planner.planQuestionArc(question, actors, orgs);
 *
 * console.log(`Uncertainty peaks on Day ${arcPlan.uncertaintyPeakDay}`);
 * console.log(`Clarity onset on Day ${arcPlan.clarityOnsetDay}`);
 * console.log(`Verification on Day ${arcPlan.verificationDay}`);
 * ```
